KmeSites_Collected.csv contains the positive samples and negative_samples_for_*.csv includes the negative samples from Uniprot.csv excluding the positive samples. The other files (except Uniprot.csv) include the positive samples from different databases. All these positive samples are combined and saved as KmeSites_Collected.csv. Specifically, PhosphoSitePlus_withEvidence.csv was generated by integrating the data files with the experimental annotation from the ID_convert_list folder and the PhosphositePlus file contains the Kme data without the experimental annotation.
